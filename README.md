# HelpEscape
Academic team project in Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Course implemented in Java. 
Using search to formulate a plan that R2-D2 can follow to escape. An optimal plan is one with as few steps as possible. The following search algorithms will be implemented and each will be used to help R2-D2:
a) Breadth-first search.
b) Depth-first search.
c) Iterative deepening search.
d) Uniform-cost search.
e) Greedy search with at least two heuristics.
f) A âˆ— search with at least two admissible heuristics.
Each of these algorithms are tested and compared in terms of the number of search tree nodes expanded.
